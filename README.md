A tab section was added to the box model solution from the HTML/CSS mini lab. Your job is to go into the Tabs.js file and get the tabs operational. The html and css needed are already in place, as is the main structure of the javascript.

Each Tab**link is associated with a Tab**item by way of the "data-tab" attribute. When a Tab**link is clicked, the associated Tab**item should be selected, as well as the Tab**link, and the previously selected elements should be deselected.
